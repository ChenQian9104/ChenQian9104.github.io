Deep generative models have proven useful for automatic design synthesis and design space exploration. However, they face three challenges when applied to engineering design: 1) generated designs lack diversity, 2) it is difficult to explicitly improve all the performance measures of generated designs, and 3) existing models generally do not generate high-performance novel designs, outside the domain of the training data. To address these challenges, we propose MO-PaDGAN, which contains a new Determinantal Point Processes based loss function for probabilistic modeling of diversity and performances. Through a real-world airfoil design example, we demonstrate that MO-PaDGAN expands the existing boundary of the design space towards high-performance regions and generates new designs with high diversity and performances exceeding training data.
