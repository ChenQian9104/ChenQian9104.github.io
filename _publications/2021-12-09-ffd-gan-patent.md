abstract: "A system and method for synthesis and optimization of smoothed surfaced three-dimensional (3D) objects uses a trainable generative adversarial network (GAN). A generator network of the GAN includes a deconvolutional neural network configured to receive a latent vector and to generate control points and weights. A Bézier layer in the generator uses the control points and weights to generate surface points of a simulated 3D surface according to a parametric Bézier curve. A GAN discriminator network includes a convolutional neural network configured to discriminate between generated surface points and surface points corresponding to training data stored in a database. The convolutional network also predicts latent vector statistics through convolution of parameters."
