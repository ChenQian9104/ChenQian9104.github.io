abstract: "Deep generative models have demonstrated effective- ness in learning compact and expressive design represen- tations that significantly improve geometric design op- timization. However, these models do not consider the uncertainty introduced by manufacturing or fabrication. Past work that quantifies such uncertainty often makes simplifying assumptions on geometric variations, while the “real-world”, “free-form” uncertainty and its impact on design performance are difficult to quantify due to the high dimensionality. To address this issue, we propose a Generative Adversarial Network-based Design under Un- certainty Framework (GAN-DUF), which contains a deep generative model that simultaneously learns a compact representation of nominal (ideal) designs and the condi- tional distribution of fabricated designs given any nom- inal design. This opens up new possibilities of 1) build- ing a universal uncertainty quantification model compat- ible with both shape and topological designs, 2) model- ing free-form geometric uncertainties without the need to make any assumptions on the distribution of geometric variability, and 3) allowing fast prediction of uncertain- ties for new nominal designs. We can combine the pro- posed deep generative model with robust design optimiza- tion or reliability-based design optimization for design under uncertainty. We demonstrated the framework on two real-world engineering design examples and showed its capability of finding the solution that possesses better performance after fabrication."
