I am a Postdoctoral Scholar at Northwestern University (lab of Prof. [Wei Chen](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/chen-wei.html)). I earned my Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Maryland, College Park (lab of Prof. [Mark Fuge](https://enme.umd.edu/clark/faculty/539/Mark-D-Fuge)), after which I worked as a Research Scientist in the Design & Simulation Systems group at [Siemens](https://new.siemens.com/us/en/company/siemens-in-the-usa/princeton.html) for one and a half years. My [research](research) explores how artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) can assist humans in solving challenging engineering design problems including extremely high-dimensional optimization problems, high-throughput inverse design, design under realistic uncertainty, and novel design discovery. The developed methodologies can be broadly applied to solving complex design problems in science and engineering domains (e.g., aerodynamic design, functional materials design, soft robot design, and design for manufacturing).
