<b>Welcome to my homepage!</b>
I am software engineer at [Siemens Industries Software Inc](https://www.sw.siemens.com/en-US/). I am working on the software development of commercial solutions to additive manufacturing. I earned my Ph.D. in Mecahnical Engineering from the University of Pittsburgh advised by Prof. [Albert To](https://www.engineering.pitt.edu/people/faculty/albert-to/). I obtained my bachelor and master degrees from Xi'an Jiaotong University, China. My academic interests are interdisciplinary, including (1) numerical modeling and optimization (2) applying machine learning techniques, such as LSTM and transformers to accelerate the conventional simulation and (3) Engineering design problems with machine learning techniques including graph neural network (GNN) and generative adversarial network (GAN).
